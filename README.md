# About the Projects:

The project deals with predicting the likelihood of E-Signing a loan based on financial history. The e-signing technique is used in this project. If the user really wants the loan he should proceed through e-signing technique. The bank checks the user’s financial history if it is good then only the user will get the loan. Many lending companies provide hundreds of loans every day, gaining money for each one.Thus the project can help them in knowing whether it is risky to give loan to the customer or not.

# ESignature:

Electronic signatures aren’t exactly a novelty. They have been around since the American Civil War, during which contracts were signed through Morse. In a modern setting, an e-Sign refers to a unique, digitised, encrypted personal identifier. This is, in essence, different from the ‘wet’ signatures created by hand. The e-Sign is meant to complete transactions, loops, and agreements electronically.

In India, the e-Sign has been granted legal status by amendments to various laws, namely the Information Technology Act, Indian Evidence Act and the Negotiable Instruments Act. Early adopters in the financial sector have started using e-Sign to get customers to sign loan and card applications, and loan agreements.
